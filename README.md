# About Ri

Ri (pronounced "ARE-ee") is a recent graduate of Columbia University seeking roles in software engineering & development (Web front-end or full-stack) and data science/engineering, with domain expertise in urban/city planning. Ri is skilled in data analytics, Web development, geographic information systems (GIS), and urban planning. Ri is a dedicated multidisciplinary practitioner, with a strong quantitative and technical foundation backed with the care of storytelling and social context research. 

Ri is an alum of Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, NY, where—in-between writing papers on race and urban history in America, coding data structures for Computer Science, and coordinating media and events for the Asian Students’ Alliance— Ri worked in Computing and Information Services serving the Art History department and the Vassar Quarterly alumni magazine, as well as making films for Vassar Stories, Vassar Admissions, and the Vassar Fund in the Vassar College Office of Communications.

Ri is proud to be a first-generation college student, a child of refugee-immigrants from the Vietnam War, a QuestBridge Scholar, and a member of the QuestBridge Alumni Association. Ri was an Associate Producer for the 2016 documentary film (Un)Privileged: The Cost of Being Poor at An Elite Institution, an independent film that explores experiences of low-income first-generation students at exclusive universities like Stanford, Harvard, and Yale University.
